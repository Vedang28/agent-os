Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Use one when a side task would flood your main conversation with search results, logs, or file contents you won’t reference again: the subagent does that work in its own context and returns only the summary. Define a custom subagent when you keep spawning the same kind of worker with the same instructions.
Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent’s description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results. To see the context savings in practice, the context window visualization walks through a session where a subagent handles research in its own separate window.
Subagents work within a single session. To run many independent sessions in parallel and monitor them from one place, see background agents. For sessions that communicate with each other, see agent teams.
Subagents help you:
Preserve context by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation
Enforce constraints by limiting which tools a subagent can use
Reuse configurations across projects with user-level subagents
Specialize behavior with focused system prompts for specific domains
Control costs by routing tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku
Claude uses each subagent’s description to decide when to delegate tasks. When you create a subagent, write a clear description so Claude knows when to use it.
Claude Code includes several built-in subagents like Explore, Plan, and general-purpose. You can also create custom subagents to handle specific tasks. This page covers:

Built-in subagents
Claude Code includes built-in subagents that Claude automatically uses when appropriate. Each inherits the parent conversation’s permissions with additional tool restrictions.
Explore and Plan skip your CLAUDE.md files and the parent session’s git status to keep research fast and inexpensive. Every other built-in and custom subagent loads both. For the full breakdown of what reaches a subagent, see what loads at startup.
Explore
Plan
General-purpose
Other
A fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases.
Model: Haiku (fast, low-latency)
Tools: Read-only tools (denied access to Write and Edit tools)
Purpose: File discovery, code search, codebase exploration
Claude delegates to Explore when it needs to search or understand a codebase without making changes. This keeps exploration results out of your main conversation context.
When invoking Explore, Claude specifies a thoroughness level: quick for targeted lookups, medium for balanced exploration, or very thorough for comprehensive analysis.
Beyond these built-in subagents, you can create your own with custom prompts, tool restrictions, permission modes, hooks, and skills. The following sections show how to get started and customize subagents.
​
Quickstart: create your first subagent
Subagents are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. You can create them manually or use the /agents command.
This walkthrough guides you through creating a user-level subagent with the /agents command. The subagent reviews code and suggests improvements for the codebase.
1
Open the subagents interface

In Claude Code, run:
/agents
2
Choose a location

Switch to the Library tab, select Create new agent, then choose Personal. This saves the subagent to ~/.claude/agents/ so it’s available in all your projects.
3
Generate with Claude

Select Generate with Claude. When prompted, describe the subagent:
A code improvement agent that scans files and suggests improvements
for readability, performance, and best practices. It should explain
each issue, show the current code, and provide an improved version.
Claude generates the identifier, description, and system prompt for you.
4
Select tools

For a read-only reviewer, deselect everything except Read-only tools. If you keep all tools selected, the subagent inherits all tools available to the main conversation.
5
Select model

Choose which model the subagent uses. For this example agent, select Sonnet, which balances capability and speed for analyzing code patterns.
6
Choose a color

Pick a background color for the subagent. This helps you identify which subagent is running in the UI.
7
Configure memory

Select User scope to give the subagent a persistent memory directory at ~/.claude/agent-memory/. The subagent uses this to accumulate insights across conversations, such as codebase patterns and recurring issues. Select None if you don’t want the subagent to persist learnings.
8
Save and try it out

Review the configuration summary. Press s or Enter to save, or press e to save and edit the file in your editor. The subagent is available immediately. Try it:
Use the code-improver agent to suggest improvements in this project
Claude delegates to your new subagent, which scans the codebase and returns improvement suggestions.
You now have a subagent you can use in any project on your machine to analyze codebases and suggest improvements.
You can also create subagents manually as Markdown files, define them via CLI flags, or distribute them through plugins. The following sections cover all configuration options.
​
Configure subagents
​
Use the /agents command
The /agents command opens a tabbed interface for managing subagents. The Running tab shows live subagents and lets you open or stop them. The Library tab lets you:
View all available subagents (built-in, user, project, and plugin)
Create new subagents with guided setup or Claude generation
Edit existing subagent configuration and tool access
Delete custom subagents
See which subagents are active when duplicates exist
This is the recommended way to create and manage subagents. For manual creation or automation, you can also add subagent files directly.
​
Choose the subagent scope
Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Store them in different locations depending on scope. When multiple subagents share the same name, the higher-priority location wins.
Location Scope Priority How to create
Managed settings Organization-wide 1 (highest) Deployed via managed settings
--agents CLI flag Current session 2 Pass JSON when launching Claude Code
.claude/agents/ Current project 3 Interactive or manual
~/.claude/agents/ All your projects 4 Interactive or manual
Plugin’s agents/ directory Where plugin is enabled 5 (lowest) Installed with plugins
Project subagents (.claude/agents/) are ideal for subagents specific to a codebase. Check them into version control so your team can use and improve them collaboratively.
Project subagents are discovered by walking up from the current working directory. Directories added with --add-dir grant file access only and are not scanned for subagents. To share subagents across projects, use ~/.claude/agents/ or a plugin.
User subagents (~/.claude/agents/) are personal subagents available in all your projects.
Claude Code scans .claude/agents/ and ~/.claude/agents/ recursively, so you can organize definitions into subfolders such as agents/review/ or agents/research/. The subdirectory path does not affect how a subagent is identified or invoked, because identity comes only from the name frontmatter field. Keep name values unique across the whole tree: if two files within one scope declare the same name, Claude Code keeps one and discards the other without warning.
Plugin agents/ directories are also scanned recursively. Unlike project and user scopes, a subfolder inside a plugin’s agents/ directory becomes part of the scoped identifier: a file at agents/review/security.md in plugin my-plugin registers as my-plugin:review:security.
CLI-defined subagents are passed as JSON when launching Claude Code. They exist only for that session and aren’t saved to disk, making them useful for quick testing or automation scripts. You can define multiple subagents in a single --agents call:
macOS, Linux, WSL
Windows PowerShell
claude --agents '{
"code-reviewer": {
"description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
"prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
"tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
"model": "sonnet"
},
"debugger": {
"description": "Debugging specialist for errors and test failures.",
"prompt": "You are an expert debugger. Analyze errors, identify root causes, and provide fixes."
}
}'
The --agents flag accepts JSON with the same frontmatter fields as file-based subagents: description, prompt, tools, disallowedTools, model, permissionMode, mcpServers, hooks, maxTurns, skills, initialPrompt, memory, effort, background, isolation, and color. Use prompt for the system prompt, equivalent to the markdown body in file-based subagents.
Managed subagents are deployed by organization administrators. Place markdown files in .claude/agents/ inside the managed settings directory, using the same frontmatter format as project and user subagents. Managed definitions take precedence over project and user subagents with the same name.
Plugin subagents come from plugins you’ve installed. They appear in /agents alongside your custom subagents. See the plugin components reference for details on creating plugin subagents.
For security reasons, plugin subagents do not support the hooks, mcpServers, or permissionMode frontmatter fields. These fields are ignored when loading agents from a plugin. If you need them, copy the agent file into .claude/agents/ or ~/.claude/agents/. You can also add rules to permissions.allow in settings.json or settings.local.json, but these rules apply to the entire session, not just the plugin subagent.
Subagent definitions from any of these scopes are also available to agent teams: when spawning a teammate, you can reference a subagent type and the teammate uses its tools and model, with the definition’s body appended to the teammate’s system prompt as additional instructions. See agent teams for which frontmatter fields apply on that path.
​
Write subagent files
Subagent files use YAML frontmatter for configuration, followed by the system prompt in Markdown:
Subagents are loaded at session start. If you add or edit a subagent file directly on disk, restart your session to load it. Subagents created through the /agents interface take effect immediately without a restart.

---

name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
model: sonnet

---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
The frontmatter defines the subagent’s metadata and configuration. The body becomes the system prompt that guides the subagent’s behavior. Subagents receive only this system prompt (plus basic environment details like working directory), not the full Claude Code system prompt.
A subagent starts in the main conversation’s current working directory. Within a subagent, cd commands do not persist between Bash or PowerShell tool calls and do not affect the main conversation’s working directory. To give the subagent an isolated copy of the repository instead, set isolation: worktree.
​
Supported frontmatter fields
The following fields can be used in the YAML frontmatter. Only name and description are required.
Field Required Description
name Yes Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens. Hooks receive this value as agent_type. The filename does not have to match
description Yes When Claude should delegate to this subagent
tools No Tools the subagent can use. Inherits all tools if omitted. To preload Skills into context, use the skills field rather than listing Skill here
disallowedTools No Tools to deny, removed from inherited or specified list
model No Model to use: sonnet, opus, haiku, a full model ID (for example, claude-opus-4-8), or inherit. Defaults to inherit
permissionMode No Permission mode: default, acceptEdits, auto, dontAsk, bypassPermissions, or plan. Ignored for plugin subagents
maxTurns No Maximum number of agentic turns before the subagent stops
skills No Skills to preload into the subagent’s context at startup. The full skill content is injected, not just the description. Subagents can still invoke unlisted project, user, and plugin skills through the Skill tool
mcpServers No MCP servers available to this subagent. Each entry is either a server name referencing an already-configured server (e.g., "slack") or an inline definition with the server name as key and a full MCP server config as value. Ignored for plugin subagents
hooks No Lifecycle hooks scoped to this subagent. Ignored for plugin subagents
memory No Persistent memory scope: user, project, or local. Enables cross-session learning
background No Set to true to always run this subagent as a background task. Default: false
effort No Effort level when this subagent is active. Overrides the session effort level. Default: inherits from session. Options: low, medium, high, xhigh, max; available levels depend on the model
isolation No Set to worktree to run the subagent in a temporary git worktree, giving it an isolated copy of the repository branched by default from your default branch rather than the parent session’s HEAD. The worktree is automatically cleaned up if the subagent makes no changes
color No Display color for the subagent in the task list and transcript. Accepts red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, or cyan
initialPrompt No Auto-submitted as the first user turn when this agent runs as the main session agent (via --agent or the agent setting). Commands and skills are processed. Prepended to any user-provided prompt
​
Choose a model
The model field controls which AI model the subagent uses:
Model alias: Use one of the available aliases: sonnet, opus, or haiku
Full model ID: Use a full model ID such as claude-opus-4-8 or claude-sonnet-4-6. Accepts the same values as the --model flag
inherit: Use the same model as the main conversation
Omitted: If not specified, defaults to inherit (uses the same model as the main conversation)
When Claude invokes a subagent, it can also pass a model parameter for that specific invocation. Claude Code resolves the subagent’s model in this order:
The CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL environment variable, if set
The per-invocation model parameter
The subagent definition’s model frontmatter
The main conversation’s model
​
Control subagent capabilities
You can control what subagents can do through tool access, permission modes, and conditional rules.
​
Available tools
Subagents inherit the internal tools and MCP tools available in the main conversation by default. The following tools depend on the main conversation’s UI or session state and are not available to subagents, even when listed in the tools field:
Agent
AskUserQuestion
EnterPlanMode
ExitPlanMode, unless the subagent’s permissionMode is plan
ScheduleWakeup
WaitForMcpServers
To restrict tools, use either the tools field (allowlist) or the disallowedTools field (denylist). This example uses tools to exclusively allow Read, Grep, Glob, and Bash. The subagent can’t edit files, write files, or use any MCP tools:

---

name: safe-researcher
description: Research agent with restricted capabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash

---

## This example uses disallowedTools to inherit every tool from the main conversation except Write and Edit. The subagent keeps Bash, MCP tools, and everything else:

name: no-writes
description: Inherits every tool except file writes
disallowedTools: Write, Edit

---

If both are set, disallowedTools is applied first, then tools is resolved against the remaining pool. A tool listed in both is removed.
​
Restrict which subagents can be spawned
When an agent runs as the main thread with claude --agent, it can spawn subagents using the Agent tool. To restrict which subagent types it can spawn, use Agent(agent_type) syntax in the tools field.
In version 2.1.63, the Task tool was renamed to Agent. Existing Task(...) references in settings and agent definitions still work as aliases.

---

name: coordinator
description: Coordinates work across specialized agents
tools: Agent(worker, researcher), Read, Bash

---

This is an allowlist: only the worker and researcher subagents can be spawned. If the agent tries to spawn any other type, the request fails and the agent sees only the allowed types in its prompt. To block specific agents while allowing all others, use permissions.deny instead.
To allow spawning any subagent without restrictions, use Agent without parentheses:
tools: Agent, Read, Bash
If Agent is omitted from the tools list entirely, the agent cannot spawn any subagents. This restriction only applies to agents running as the main thread with claude --agent. Subagents cannot spawn other subagents, so Agent(agent_type) has no effect in subagent definitions.
​
Scope MCP servers to a subagent
Use the mcpServers field to give a subagent access to MCP servers that aren’t available in the main conversation. Inline servers defined here are connected when the subagent starts and disconnected when it finishes. String references share the parent session’s connection.
The mcpServers field applies in both contexts where an agent file can run:
As a subagent, spawned through the Agent tool or an @-mention
As the main session, launched with --agent or the agent setting
When the agent is the main session, inline server definitions connect at startup alongside servers from .mcp.json and settings files.
Each entry in the list is either an inline server definition or a string referencing an MCP server already configured in your session:

---

name: browser-tester
description: Tests features in a real browser using Playwright
mcpServers:

# Inline definition: scoped to this subagent only

- playwright:
  type: stdio
  command: npx
  args: ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]

# Reference by name: reuses an already-configured server

- github

---

Use the Playwright tools to navigate, screenshot, and interact with pages.
Inline definitions use the same schema as .mcp.json server entries (stdio, http, sse, ws), keyed by the server name.
To keep an MCP server out of the main conversation entirely and avoid its tool descriptions consuming context there, define it inline here rather than in .mcp.json. The subagent gets the tools; the parent conversation does not.
As of v2.1.153, the MCP restrictions that apply to the main session also cover servers declared in subagent frontmatter:
--strict-mcp-config and --bare
Enterprise managed MCP configuration
allowedMcpServers and deniedMcpServers policies
When one of these blocks a server, Claude Code skips it and shows a warning naming the blocked servers.
Managed-settings restrictions apply to every subagent regardless of how it is defined. --strict-mcp-config does not filter servers you pass inline via --agents or the SDK agents option, since those are explicit caller input.
​
Permission modes
The permissionMode field controls how the subagent handles permission prompts. Subagents inherit the permission context from the main conversation and can override the mode, except when the parent mode takes precedence as described below.
Mode Behavior
default Standard permission checking with prompts
acceptEdits Auto-accept file edits and common filesystem commands for paths in the working directory or additionalDirectories
auto Auto mode: a background classifier reviews commands and protected-directory writes
dontAsk Auto-deny permission prompts (explicitly allowed tools still work)
bypassPermissions Skip permission prompts
plan Plan mode (read-only exploration)
Use bypassPermissions with caution. It skips all permission prompts, allowing the subagent to execute operations without approval, including writes to .git, .claude, .vscode, .idea, and .husky. Root and home directory removals such as rm -rf / still prompt as a circuit breaker. See permission modes for details.
If the parent uses bypassPermissions or acceptEdits, this takes precedence and cannot be overridden. If the parent uses auto mode, the subagent inherits auto mode and any permissionMode in its frontmatter is ignored: the classifier evaluates the subagent’s tool calls with the same block and allow rules as the parent session.
​
Preload skills into subagents
Use the skills field to inject skill content into a subagent’s context at startup. This gives the subagent domain knowledge without requiring it to discover and load skills during execution.

---

name: api-developer
description: Implement API endpoints following team conventions
skills:

- api-conventions
- error-handling-patterns

---

Implement API endpoints. Follow the conventions and patterns from the preloaded skills.
The full content of each listed skill is injected into the subagent’s context at startup. This field controls which skills are preloaded, not which skills the subagent can access: without it, the subagent can still discover and invoke project, user, and plugin skills through the Skill tool during execution. To prevent a subagent from invoking skills entirely, omit Skill from the tools list or add it to disallowedTools.
You cannot preload skills that set disable-model-invocation: true, since preloading draws from the same set of skills Claude can invoke. If a listed skill is missing or disabled, Claude Code skips it and logs a warning to the debug log.
This is the inverse of running a skill in a subagent. With skills in a subagent, the subagent controls the system prompt and loads skill content. With context: fork in a skill, the skill content is injected into the agent you specify. Both use the same underlying system.
​
Enable persistent memory
The memory field gives the subagent a persistent directory that survives across conversations. The subagent uses this directory to build up knowledge over time, such as codebase patterns, debugging insights, and architectural decisions.

---

name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
memory: user

---

You are a code reviewer. As you review code, update your agent memory with
patterns, conventions, and recurring issues you discover.
Choose a scope based on how broadly the memory should apply:
Scope Location Use when
user ~/.claude/agent-memory/<name-of-agent>/ the subagent should remember learnings across all projects
project .claude/agent-memory/<name-of-agent>/ the subagent’s knowledge is project-specific and shareable via version control
local .claude/agent-memory-local/<name-of-agent>/ the subagent’s knowledge is project-specific but should not be checked into version control
When memory is enabled:
The subagent’s system prompt includes instructions for reading and writing to the memory directory.
The subagent’s system prompt also includes the first 200 lines or 25KB of MEMORY.md in the memory directory, whichever comes first, with instructions to curate MEMORY.md if it exceeds that limit.
Read, Write, and Edit tools are automatically enabled so the subagent can manage its memory files.
Persistent memory tips
project is the recommended default scope. It makes subagent knowledge shareable via version control. Use user when the subagent’s knowledge is broadly applicable across projects, or local when the knowledge should not be checked into version control.
Ask the subagent to consult its memory before starting work: “Review this PR, and check your memory for patterns you’ve seen before.”
Ask the subagent to update its memory after completing a task: “Now that you’re done, save what you learned to your memory.” Over time, this builds a knowledge base that makes the subagent more effective.
Include memory instructions directly in the subagent’s markdown file so it proactively maintains its own knowledge base:
Update your agent memory as you discover codepaths, patterns, library
locations, and key architectural decisions. This builds up institutional
knowledge across conversations. Write concise notes about what you found
and where.
​
Conditional rules with hooks
For more dynamic control over tool usage, use PreToolUse hooks to validate operations before they execute. This is useful when you need to allow some operations of a tool while blocking others.
This example creates a subagent that only allows read-only database queries. The PreToolUse hook runs the script specified in command before each Bash command executes:

---

name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries
tools: Bash
hooks:
PreToolUse: - matcher: "Bash"
hooks: - type: command
command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"

---

Claude Code passes hook input as JSON via stdin to hook commands. The validation script reads this JSON, extracts the Bash command, and exits with code 2 to block write operations:
#!/bin/bash

# ./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh

INPUT=$(cat)
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

# Block SQL write operations (case-insensitive)

if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -iE '\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE)\b' > /dev/null; then
echo "Blocked: Only SELECT queries are allowed" >&2
exit 2
fi

exit 0
See Hook input for the complete input schema and exit codes for how exit codes affect behavior. On Windows, write hook scripts in PowerShell and add shell: powershell to the hook entry as shown in running hooks in PowerShell.
​
Disable specific subagents
You can prevent Claude from using specific subagents by adding them to the deny array in your settings. Use the format Agent(subagent-name) where subagent-name matches the subagent’s name field.
{
"permissions": {
"deny": ["Agent(Explore)", "Agent(my-custom-agent)"]
}
}
This works for both built-in and custom subagents. You can also use the --disallowedTools CLI flag:
claude --disallowedTools "Agent(Explore)"
See Permissions documentation for more details on permission rules.
​
Define hooks for subagents
Subagents can define hooks that run during the subagent’s lifecycle. There are two ways to configure hooks:
In the subagent’s frontmatter: Define hooks that run only while that subagent is active
In settings.json: Define hooks that run in the main session when subagents start or stop
​
Hooks in subagent frontmatter
Define hooks directly in the subagent’s markdown file. These hooks only run while that specific subagent is active and are cleaned up when it finishes.
Frontmatter hooks fire when the agent is spawned as a subagent through the Agent tool or an @-mention, and when the agent runs as the main session via --agent or the agent setting. In the main-session case they run alongside any hooks defined in settings.json.
All hook events are supported. The most common events for subagents are:
Event Matcher input When it fires
PreToolUse Tool name Before the subagent uses a tool
PostToolUse Tool name After the subagent uses a tool
Stop (none) When the subagent finishes (converted to SubagentStop at runtime)
This example validates Bash commands with the PreToolUse hook and runs a linter after file edits with PostToolUse:

---

name: code-reviewer
description: Review code changes with automatic linting
hooks:
PreToolUse: - matcher: "Bash"
hooks: - type: command
command: "./scripts/validate-command.sh $TOOL_INPUT"
PostToolUse: - matcher: "Edit|Write"
hooks: - type: command
command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"

---

When the agent is invoked as a subagent, Stop hooks in frontmatter are automatically converted to SubagentStop events.
​
Project-level hooks for subagent events
Configure hooks in settings.json that respond to subagent lifecycle events in the main session.
Event Matcher input When it fires
SubagentStart Agent type name When a subagent begins execution
SubagentStop Agent type name When a subagent completes
Both events support matchers to target specific agent types by name. This example runs a setup script only when the db-agent subagent starts, and a cleanup script when any subagent stops:
{
"hooks": {
"SubagentStart": [
{
"matcher": "db-agent",
"hooks": [
{ "type": "command", "command": "./scripts/setup-db-connection.sh" }
]
}
],
"SubagentStop": [
{
"hooks": [
{ "type": "command", "command": "./scripts/cleanup-db-connection.sh" }
]
}
]
}
}
See Hooks for the complete hook configuration format.
​
Work with subagents
​
Understand automatic delegation
Claude automatically delegates tasks based on the task description in your request, the description field in subagent configurations, and current context. To encourage proactive delegation, include phrases like “use proactively” in your subagent’s description field.
​
Invoke subagents explicitly
When automatic delegation isn’t enough, you can request a subagent yourself. Three patterns escalate from a one-off suggestion to a session-wide default:
Natural language: name the subagent in your prompt; Claude decides whether to delegate
@-mention: guarantees the subagent runs for one task
Session-wide: the whole session uses that subagent’s system prompt, tool restrictions, and model via the --agent flag or the agent setting
For natural language, there’s no special syntax. Name the subagent and Claude typically delegates:
Use the test-runner subagent to fix failing tests
Have the code-reviewer subagent look at my recent changes
@-mention the subagent. Type @ and pick the subagent from the typeahead, the same way you @-mention files. This ensures that specific subagent runs rather than leaving the choice to Claude:
@"code-reviewer (agent)" look at the auth changes
Your full message still goes to Claude, which writes the subagent’s task prompt based on what you asked. The @-mention controls which subagent Claude invokes, not what prompt it receives.
Subagents provided by an enabled plugin appear in the typeahead under their scoped name, such as my-plugin:code-reviewer or my-plugin:review:security when the plugin organizes agents into subfolders. Named background subagents currently running in the session also appear in the typeahead, showing their status next to the name. You can also type the mention manually without using the picker: @agent-<name> for local subagents, or @agent- followed by the scoped name for plugin subagents, for example @agent-my-plugin:code-reviewer.
Run the whole session as a subagent. Pass --agent <name> to start a session where the main thread itself takes on that subagent’s system prompt, tool restrictions, and model:
claude --agent code-reviewer
The subagent’s system prompt replaces the default Claude Code system prompt entirely, the same way --system-prompt does. CLAUDE.md files and project memory still load through the normal message flow. The agent name appears as @<name> in the startup header so you can confirm it’s active.
This works with built-in and custom subagents, and the choice persists when you resume the session.
For a plugin-provided subagent, you can pass just the agent name and Claude Code will find it:
claude --agent security-reviewer
If multiple plugins provide agents with the same name, pass the scoped name to disambiguate:
claude --agent my-plugin:security-reviewer
If the plugin places the agent in a subfolder of its agents/ directory, include the subfolder in the scoped name, for example claude --agent my-plugin:review:security.
To make it the default for every session in a project, set agent in .claude/settings.json:
{
"agent": "code-reviewer"
}
The CLI flag overrides the setting if both are present.
​
Run subagents in foreground or background
Subagents can run in the foreground (blocking) or background (concurrent):
Foreground subagents block the main conversation until complete. Permission prompts are passed through to you as they come up.
Background subagents run concurrently while you continue working. They run with the permissions already granted in the session and auto-deny any tool call that would otherwise prompt. If a background subagent needs to ask clarifying questions, that tool call fails but the subagent continues.
If a background subagent fails due to missing permissions, you can start a new foreground subagent with the same task to retry with interactive prompts.
Claude decides whether to run subagents in the foreground or background based on the task. You can also:
Ask Claude to “run this in the background”
Press Ctrl+B to background a running task
To disable all background task functionality, set the CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS environment variable to 1. See Environment variables.
When fork mode is enabled, every subagent spawn runs in the background regardless of the background field. Forks still surface permission prompts in your terminal as they occur; named subagents auto-deny anything that would prompt, as described above.
​
Common patterns
​
Isolate high-volume operations
One of the most effective uses for subagents is isolating operations that produce large amounts of output. Running tests, fetching documentation, or processing log files can consume significant context. By delegating these to a subagent, the verbose output stays in the subagent’s context while only the relevant summary returns to your main conversation.
Use a subagent to run the test suite and report only the failing tests with their error messages
​
Run parallel research
For independent investigations, spawn multiple subagents to work simultaneously:
Research the authentication, database, and API modules in parallel using separate subagents
Each subagent explores its area independently, then Claude synthesizes the findings. This works best when the research paths don’t depend on each other.
When subagents complete, their results return to your main conversation. Running many subagents that each return detailed results can consume significant context.
For tasks that need sustained parallelism or exceed your context window, agent teams give each worker its own independent context.
​
Chain subagents
For multi-step workflows, ask Claude to use subagents in sequence. Each subagent completes its task and returns results to Claude, which then passes relevant context to the next subagent.
Use the code-reviewer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
​
Choose between subagents and main conversation
Use the main conversation when:
The task needs frequent back-and-forth or iterative refinement
Multiple phases share significant context (planning → implementation → testing)
You’re making a quick, targeted change
Latency matters. Subagents start fresh and may need time to gather context
Use subagents when:
The task produces verbose output you don’t need in your main context
You want to enforce specific tool restrictions or permissions
The work is self-contained and can return a summary
Consider Skills instead when you want reusable prompts or workflows that run in the main conversation context rather than isolated subagent context.
For a quick question about something already in your conversation, use /btw instead of a subagent. It sees your full context but has no tool access, and the answer is discarded rather than added to history.
Subagents cannot spawn other subagents. If your workflow requires nested delegation, use Skills or chain subagents from the main conversation.
​
Manage subagent context
​
What loads at startup
Each subagent starts with a fresh, isolated context window. It does not see your conversation history, the skills you’ve already invoked, or the files Claude has already read. Claude composes a delegation message that summarizes the task, and the subagent works from there. The exception is a fork, which inherits the parent conversation instead of starting fresh.
A non-fork subagent’s initial context contains:
System prompt: the agent’s own prompt plus environment details that Claude Code appends, not the full Claude Code system prompt. Custom subagents define theirs in the markdown body or prompt field. Built-in agents have predefined prompts.
Task message: the delegation prompt Claude writes when it hands off the work.
CLAUDE.md and memory: every level of the memory hierarchy the main conversation loads, including ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md, project rules, CLAUDE.local.md, and managed policy files. The built-in Explore and Plan agents skip this.
Git status: a snapshot taken at the start of the parent session. Absent when the working directory isn’t a Git repository or when includeGitInstructions is false. Explore and Plan skip it regardless.
Preloaded skills: full content of any skill named in the agent’s skills field. Built-in agents don’t preload skills.
Explore and Plan are the only subagents that omit CLAUDE.md and git status. There is no frontmatter field or per-agent setting to change which agents skip them.
The main conversation reads Explore and Plan results with full CLAUDE.md context, so most rules don’t need to reach the subagent itself. If a rule must, such as “ignore the vendor/ directory,” restate it in the prompt you give Claude when delegating.
​
Resume subagents
Each subagent invocation creates a new instance with fresh context. To continue an existing subagent’s work instead of starting over, ask Claude to resume it.
Resumed subagents retain their full conversation history, including all previous tool calls, results, and reasoning. The subagent picks up exactly where it stopped rather than starting fresh.
When a subagent completes, Claude receives its agent ID. Claude uses the SendMessage tool with the agent’s ID as the to field to resume it. The SendMessage tool is only available when agent teams are enabled via CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1.
To resume a subagent, ask Claude to continue the previous work:
Use the code-reviewer subagent to review the authentication module
[Agent completes]

Continue that code review and now analyze the authorization logic
[Claude resumes the subagent with full context from previous conversation]
If a stopped subagent receives a SendMessage, it auto-resumes in the background without requiring a new Agent invocation.
You can also ask Claude for the agent ID if you want to reference it explicitly, or find IDs in the transcript files at ~/.claude/projects/{project}/{sessionId}/subagents/. Each transcript is stored as agent-{agentId}.jsonl.
Subagent transcripts persist independently of the main conversation:
Main conversation compaction: When the main conversation compacts, subagent transcripts are unaffected. They’re stored in separate files.
Session persistence: Subagent transcripts persist within their session. You can resume a subagent after restarting Claude Code by resuming the same session.
Automatic cleanup: Transcripts are cleaned up based on the cleanupPeriodDays setting (default: 30 days).
​
Auto-compaction
Subagents support automatic compaction using the same logic as the main conversation. By default, auto-compaction triggers at approximately 95% capacity. To trigger compaction earlier, set CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE to a lower percentage (for example, 50). See environment variables for details.
Compaction events are logged in subagent transcript files:
{
"type": "system",
"subtype": "compact_boundary",
"compactMetadata": {
"trigger": "auto",
"preTokens": 167189
}
}
The preTokens value shows how many tokens were used before compaction occurred.
​
Fork the current conversation
Forked subagents are experimental and require Claude Code v2.1.117 or later. Behavior and configuration may change in future releases. Enable them by setting the CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT environment variable to 1. The variable is honored in interactive mode and via the SDK or claude -p.
A fork is a subagent that inherits the entire conversation so far instead of starting fresh. This drops the input isolation that subagents otherwise provide: a fork sees the same system prompt, tools, model, and message history as the main session, so you can hand it a side task without re-explaining the situation. The fork’s own tool calls still stay out of your conversation and only its final result comes back, so your main context window stays clean. Use a fork when a named subagent would need too much background to be useful, or when you want to try several approaches in parallel from the same starting point.
Enabling fork mode changes Claude Code in three ways:
Claude spawns a fork whenever it would otherwise use the general-purpose subagent. Named subagents such as Explore still spawn as before.
Every subagent spawn runs in the background, whether it is a fork or a named subagent. Set CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS to 1 to keep spawns synchronous.
The /fork command spawns a fork instead of acting as an alias for /branch.
You can start a fork yourself with /fork followed by a directive. Claude Code names the fork from the first words of the directive. The following example forks the conversation to draft test cases while you continue with the implementation in the main session:
/fork draft unit tests for the parser changes so far
The fork appears in a panel below your prompt and runs in the background while you keep working. When it finishes, its result arrives as a message in your main conversation. The next section covers the panel controls for watching and steering forks while they run.
​
Observe and steer running forks
Running forks appear in a panel below the prompt input, with one row for the main session and one for each fork. Use these keys to interact with the panel:
Key Action
↑ / ↓ Move between rows
Enter Open the selected fork’s transcript and send it follow-up messages
x Dismiss a finished fork or stop a running one
Esc Return focus to the prompt input
​
How forks differ from named subagents
A fork inherits everything the main session has at the moment it spawns. A named subagent starts from its own definition.
Fork Named subagent
Context Full conversation history Fresh context with the prompt you pass
System prompt and tools Same as main session From the subagent’s definition file
Model Same as main session From the subagent’s model field
Permissions Prompts surface in your terminal Auto-denied when running in the background
Prompt cache Shared with main session Separate cache
Because a fork’s system prompt and tool definitions are identical to the parent, its first request reuses the parent’s prompt cache. This makes forking cheaper than spawning a fresh subagent for tasks that need the same context.
When Claude spawns a fork through the Agent tool, it can pass isolation: "worktree" so the fork’s file edits are written to a separate git worktree instead of your checkout.
​
Limitations
Setting CLAUDE_CODE_FORK_SUBAGENT=1 enables fork mode in interactive sessions, non-interactive mode, and the Agent SDK. A fork cannot spawn further forks.
​
Example subagents
These examples demonstrate effective patterns for building subagents. Use them as starting points, or generate a customized version with Claude.
Best practices:
Design focused subagents: each subagent should excel at one specific task
Write detailed descriptions: Claude uses the description to decide when to delegate
Limit tool access: grant only necessary permissions for security and focus
Check into version control: share project subagents with your team
​
Code reviewer
A read-only subagent that reviews code without modifying it. This example shows how to design a focused subagent with limited tool access (no Edit or Write) and a detailed prompt that specifies exactly what to look for and how to format output.

---

name: code-reviewer
description: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: inherit

---

You are a senior code reviewer ensuring high standards of code quality and security.

When invoked:

1. Run git diff to see recent changes
2. Focus on modified files
3. Begin review immediately

Review checklist:

- Code is clear and readable
- Functions and variables are well-named
- No duplicated code
- Proper error handling
- No exposed secrets or API keys
- Input validation implemented
- Good test coverage
- Performance considerations addressed

Provide feedback organized by priority:

- Critical issues (must fix)
- Warnings (should fix)
- Suggestions (consider improving)

Include specific examples of how to fix issues.
​
Debugger
A subagent that can both analyze and fix issues. Unlike the code reviewer, this one includes Edit because fixing bugs requires modifying code. The prompt provides a clear workflow from diagnosis to verification.

---

name: debugger
description: Debugging specialist for errors, test failures, and unexpected behavior. Use proactively when encountering any issues.
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob

---

You are an expert debugger specializing in root cause analysis.

When invoked:

1. Capture error message and stack trace
2. Identify reproduction steps
3. Isolate the failure location
4. Implement minimal fix
5. Verify solution works

Debugging process:

- Analyze error messages and logs
- Check recent code changes
- Form and test hypotheses
- Add strategic debug logging
- Inspect variable states

For each issue, provide:

- Root cause explanation
- Evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Specific code fix
- Testing approach
- Prevention recommendations

Focus on fixing the underlying issue, not the symptoms.
​
Data scientist
A domain-specific subagent for data analysis work. This example shows how to create subagents for specialized workflows outside of typical coding tasks. It explicitly sets model: sonnet for more capable analysis.

---

name: data-scientist
description: Data analysis expert for SQL queries, BigQuery operations, and data insights. Use proactively for data analysis tasks and queries.
tools: Bash, Read, Write
model: sonnet

---

You are a data scientist specializing in SQL and BigQuery analysis.

When invoked:

1. Understand the data analysis requirement
2. Write efficient SQL queries
3. Use BigQuery command line tools (bq) when appropriate
4. Analyze and summarize results
5. Present findings clearly

Key practices:

- Write optimized SQL queries with proper filters
- Use appropriate aggregations and joins
- Include comments explaining complex logic
- Format results for readability
- Provide data-driven recommendations

For each analysis:

- Explain the query approach
- Document any assumptions
- Highlight key findings
- Suggest next steps based on data

Always ensure queries are efficient and cost-effective.
​
Database query validator
A subagent that allows Bash access but validates commands to permit only read-only SQL queries. This example shows how to use PreToolUse hooks for conditional validation when you need finer control than the tools field provides.

---

name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries. Use when analyzing data or generating reports.
tools: Bash
hooks:
PreToolUse: - matcher: "Bash"
hooks: - type: command
command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"

---

You are a database analyst with read-only access. Execute SELECT queries to answer questions about the data.

When asked to analyze data:

1. Identify which tables contain the relevant data
2. Write efficient SELECT queries with appropriate filters
3. Present results clearly with context

You cannot modify data. If asked to INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or modify schema, explain that you only have read access.
Claude Code passes hook input as JSON via stdin to hook commands. The validation script reads this JSON, extracts the command being executed, and checks it against a list of SQL write operations. If a write operation is detected, the script exits with code 2 to block execution and returns an error message to Claude via stderr.
Create the validation script anywhere in your project. The path must match the command field in your hook configuration:
#!/bin/bash

# Blocks SQL write operations, allows SELECT queries

# Read JSON input from stdin

INPUT=$(cat)

# Extract the command field from tool_input using jq

COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

if [ -z "$COMMAND" ]; then
exit 0
fi

# Block write operations (case-insensitive)

if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -iE '\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE|REPLACE|MERGE)\b' > /dev/null; then
echo "Blocked: Write operations not allowed. Use SELECT queries only." >&2
exit 2
fi

exit 0
On macOS and Linux, make the script executable:
chmod +x ./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh
On Windows, write the validation script in PowerShell and add shell: powershell to the hook entry. See running hooks in PowerShell.
The hook receives JSON via stdin with the Bash command in tool_input.command. Exit code 2 blocks the operation and feeds the error message back to Claude. See Hooks for details on exit codes and Hook input for the complete input schema.

Use this file to discover all available pages before exploring further.

Agent view, opened with claude agents, is one screen for all your background sessions: what’s running, what needs your input, and what’s done. Dispatch new sessions, watch their state at a glance instead of scrolling through transcripts, and step in only when one needs you. Each background session is a full Claude Code conversation that keeps running without a terminal attached, so you can open it, reply, and leave whenever you want.
Agent view in a terminal: the header shows Claude Code v2.1.140, the model, the working directory, and a summary count. Sessions are grouped under Needs input, Working, and Completed, with a dispatch input at the bottom and a footer of keyboard hints.
Use agent view when you have several independent tasks Claude can work on without you watching every step. Dispatch a bug fix, a pull request review, and a flaky-test investigation as three rows, keep working in another window, and check back when a row shows it needs you or has a result.
When you want to work more directly in any agent’s session, attach to the row to enter the full conversation.
To compare agent view with subagents, agent teams, and worktrees, see Run agents in parallel.
Agent view is in research preview and requires Claude Code v2.1.139 or later. Check your version with claude --version. The interface and keyboard shortcuts may change as the feature evolves.
This page covers:
Quick start: give Claude a task to work on in the background, check on it, and step in when needed
Monitor sessions with agent view, including state icons, peeking and replying, attaching, organizing, and keyboard shortcuts
Dispatch new agents from agent view, from inside a session, or from your shell
Manage sessions from the shell
How background sessions are hosted by the supervisor process
​
Quick start
This walkthrough covers the core agent view loop: dispatch a task, watch its row update as Claude works, peek to check on it and reply, and attach for the full conversation. The session you dispatch keeps running after you close agent view, so you can leave and come back to it.
1
Open agent view

From your shell, run:
claude agents
Agent view opens with an input at the bottom and a table that fills in as sessions start. Press Esc at any time to return to your shell. Your sessions keep running while you’re away and reappear the next time you open agent view.
2
Dispatch a session

Type a prompt describing a task and press Enter. A new background session starts on that task and appears as a row showing whether it’s working, waiting on you, or done. The new session uses the model shown in the agent view header and the same permission mode you’d get running claude in that directory.
Every prompt you enter here starts its own new session. Typing another prompt and pressing Enter launches a second session alongside the first rather than sending a follow-up to it. You can run several in parallel this way.
Each session uses your subscription quota independently, so see Limitations before dispatching many at once.
3
Peek and reply

Select a row with the arrow keys and press Space to open the peek panel. It shows the session’s most recent output, or the question it’s waiting on, rather than the full transcript. Type a reply and press Enter to send it without leaving agent view.
4
Attach and detach

Press Enter or → on a row to attach when you want the full conversation. The session takes over the terminal exactly as if you had run claude. Press ← on an empty prompt to detach and return to the table.
5
Bring an existing session in

To move a session you already have open into agent view, run /bg inside it, or press ← on an empty prompt to background it and open agent view in one step. The session keeps running and appears as a row alongside the ones you dispatched.
You can use claude agents as your primary entry point instead of claude: dispatch every task from agent view, attach when you want the full conversation, and press ← to return to the table.
​
Monitor sessions with agent view
Run claude agents to open agent view. It takes over the full terminal and lists every session grouped by state, with pinned sessions and the ones that need you at the top. Each row shows the session’s name, current activity, and how long ago it last changed.
By default the list shows every background session you’ve started, across all your projects. A session working in one repository and another in a different worktree both appear here, regardless of which directory you opened agent view from. To narrow the list to one project, pass --cwd (requires Claude Code v2.1.141 or later):
claude agents --cwd ~/projects/my-app
This shows only sessions started under that directory. A session that has moved into a worktree under ~/projects/my-app/.claude/worktrees/ still counts as belonging to ~/projects/my-app.
Interactive sessions you have open in other terminals don’t appear until you background them. Subagents and teammates a session spawns aren’t listed as separate rows.

​
Read session state
Each row starts with an icon whose color and animation show the session’s state:
State Icon shows as What it means
Working Animated Claude is actively running tools or generating a response
Needs input Yellow Claude is waiting on a specific question or permission decision from you
Idle Dimmed The session has nothing to do and is ready for your next prompt
Completed Green The task finished successfully
Failed Red The task ended with an error
Stopped Grey The session was stopped with Ctrl+X or claude stop
Separately, the icon’s shape shows whether the underlying process is running:
Shape What it means
✻ or animated ✽ The session process is alive and replies immediately
∙ The process has exited. You can still peek, reply, or attach, and Claude restarts from where it left off
✢ A /loop session sleeping between iterations. The row shows its run count and a countdown
The PR #N label that can appear at the right edge of a row is the pull request the session opened, not part of the state icon. When a session has opened more than one pull request, the label shows a count instead, such as 3 PRs.
The terminal tab title shows the awaiting-input count while agent view is open: 2 awaiting input · claude agents when sessions need input, or claude agents when none do.
Background sessions don’t need any terminal open to keep working. A separate supervisor process runs them, so you can close agent view, close your shell, or start a new interactive session and your dispatched work keeps going.
Session state persists on disk through auto-updates and supervisor restarts. Sessions are also preserved when your machine sleeps. Their processes resume on wake and the supervisor reconnects to them instead of treating the time gap as idle. Shutting down still stops running sessions; see Sessions show as failed after shutdown for how to recover them.
​
Row summaries
The one-line summary in each row is generated by a Haiku-class model so the row can tell you what the session is doing, what it needs, or what it produced without opening the transcript. While a session is actively working, the summary refreshes at most once every 15 seconds, plus once when each turn ends.
Each refresh is one short Haiku-class request through your normal provider, billed and handled under the same data usage terms as the session itself.
​
Pull request status
When a session opens a pull request, a PR #1234 label appears at the right edge of the row, linked to the pull request in terminals that support hyperlinks. The label persists when you send a follow-up to the session, so the pull request remains visible while the row reverts to live progress.
When a session has opened more than one pull request, the label shows a count instead, such as 3 PRs, colored by the open pull request that most needs attention. Open the peek panel to see them all.
The pull request number is colored by its status:
Color Pull request status
Yellow Waiting on checks or review, or checks failed
Green Checks passed and no review is blocking
Purple Merged
Grey Draft or closed
For most tasks this column is where you pick up the result: review and merge the pull request when its number turns green.
​
Peek and reply
Press Space on a selected row to open the peek panel. It shows what the session needs from you, its most recent output, and any pull requests it opened. Most of the time this is enough, and you never need to open the full transcript.
Type a reply in the peek panel and press Enter to send it to that session. When the session is asking a multiple-choice question, the peek panel shows the options and you can press a number key to pick one. For other blocked sessions, press Tab to fill the input with a suggested reply you can edit before sending. Prefix a reply with ! to send a Bash command instead.
Use ↑ and ↓ to peek at adjacent sessions without closing the panel, or → to attach.
​
Attach to a session
Press Enter or → on a selected row to attach. Agent view is replaced by the full interactive session, exactly as if you had run claude in that directory. When you attach, Claude posts a short recap of what happened while you were away.
While attached, the session behaves like any other Claude Code session: every command, keyboard shortcut, and feature works.
Press ← on an empty prompt to detach and return to agent view. If a dialog has focus and isn’t responding to ←, press Ctrl+Z to detach immediately.
Ctrl+C keeps its standard interrupt behavior while attached: it cancels a running response or ! shell command rather than detaching. Pressing Ctrl+C twice on an empty prompt detaches, the same as in any session.
Detaching never stops a background session: ←, Ctrl+Z, /exit, and double Ctrl+C or double Ctrl+D all leave it running. To end a session from inside it, run /stop.
Pressing ← on an empty prompt works from any Claude Code session, not only ones you attached to from agent view. It backgrounds the current session and opens agent view with that row selected, so you can switch sessions without leaving the terminal. The row is created even from a fresh session with no conversation history, so → returns to it. When that row is the only one, agent view shows an onboarding hint below it. You can turn this shortcut off in /config (the leftArrowOpensAgents setting).
​
Organize the list
Agent view groups sessions so the ones that need input are at the top, with Ready for review and Needs input above Working and Completed. These group names don’t map one-to-one to the states above: a session moves to Ready for review when it has an open pull request, and Completed collects finished, failed, and stopped sessions together. Press Ctrl+S to group by directory instead. Your choice persists across runs.
Within a group:
Press Ctrl+T to pin a session to the top and keep its process running while idle
Press Shift+↑ or Shift+↓ to reorder sessions
Press Ctrl+R to rename a session
Press Enter on a group header to collapse it
To remove a session from the list, press Ctrl+X to stop it and Ctrl+X again within two seconds to delete it. Pressing Ctrl+X on a group header deletes every session in that group after confirmation.
Deleting removes the session from agent view. If Claude created a worktree for the session, deleting removes that worktree too, including any uncommitted changes in it, so push or commit work you want to keep first. A worktree you created yourself and started the session inside is left in place. The conversation transcript stays on your local machine and remains available through claude --resume.
Older completed sessions fold into a … N more row to keep the list short. Failures and sessions with an open pull request always stay visible.
​
Filter sessions
Type in the dispatch input to filter instead of dispatching:
Filter Shows
a:<name> Sessions running the named agent
s:<state> Sessions in the given state, such as s:working. Also accepts s:blocked for everything waiting on you #<number> or a PR URL The session working on that pull request
​

​
Dispatch new agents
You can dispatch new background sessions from agent view, send an existing interactive session to the background, or start one directly from the shell.
​
From agent view
Type a prompt in the input at the bottom of agent view and press Enter to start a new background session. The session is named automatically from the prompt; rename it later with Ctrl+R.
Paste an image into the prompt to include a screenshot or diagram with the task.
Prefix or mention parts of the prompt to control how the session starts:
Input Effect
<agent-name> <prompt> If the first word matches a custom subagent name, that subagent runs as the session’s main agent with the configuration from its frontmatter
@<agent-name> Mention a custom subagent anywhere in the prompt to run it as the main agent
@<repo> Mention a repository under the directory you opened agent view from to run the session there
/<command> Suggest skills and commands to dispatch as the prompt
! <command> Run a shell command as a background job instead of starting a Claude session. The job appears as a row you can attach to, watch, and detach from #<number> or a pull request URL If a session is already working on that PR, select it instead of dispatching
Shift+Enter Dispatch and immediately attach to the new session
Packaging a recurring task as a skill lets you start the same workflow from agent view repeatedly without retyping the prompt.
When the same @name matches both a subagent and a sibling repository, the subagent takes precedence. The bare first-word match also applies, so a prompt that happens to begin with one of your subagent names dispatches that subagent rather than treating the word as plain text. Use the @ form when you want to be explicit, or start the prompt with a different word to avoid the match.
​
Dispatch to a specific directory
A new session runs in the directory you opened agent view from. To target a different directory:
Open claude agents in that directory.
Open claude agents in a parent directory that holds several repositories and mention one with @<repo> in the prompt to run the session there.
From the shell, cd into the directory and run claude --bg "<prompt>".
When agent view is grouped by directory, the highlighted row’s directory becomes the dispatch target, so you can scroll to a group and dispatch into it without retyping the path.
​
From inside a session
Run /background or its alias /bg to move the current conversation into a background session. Pass a prompt such as /bg run the test suite and fix any failures to give one more instruction first. If Claude is responding when you run /bg, the response continues in the background session.
Backgrounding from an interactive session starts a fresh process that resumes from the saved conversation, so running subagents, monitors, and background commands do not transfer to it. Claude asks you to confirm before backgrounding when any are running. Once in the background, the session can start new subagents, monitors, and background commands, and those keep running across later detach and reattach.
Configuration flags from the original launch carry through to the backgrounded session, so its MCP servers, settings, and fallback model remain in effect:
--mcp-config and --strict-mcp-config
--settings
--add-dir
--plugin-dir
--fallback-model
--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions
Directories you added during the session with /add-dir also carry through.
Carrying --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions through keeps bypassPermissions reachable in the backgrounded session, but it does not grant anything new. The mode still requires the same one-time interactive acceptance described in Permission mode, model, and effort before any session can use it.
​
From your shell
Pass --bg to start a session that goes straight to the background:
claude --bg "investigate the flaky SettingsChangeDetector test"
To run a specific subagent as the session’s main agent, combine --bg with --agent:
claude --agent code-reviewer --bg "address review comments on PR 1234"
Pass --name to set the session’s display name in agent view instead of the auto-generated one:
claude --bg --name "flaky-test-fix" "investigate the flaky SettingsChangeDetector test"
After backgrounding, Claude prints the session’s short ID and the commands for managing it. When you pass --name, the name appears after the short ID:
backgrounded · 7c5dcf5d · flaky-test-fix
claude agents list sessions
claude attach 7c5dcf5d open in this terminal
claude logs 7c5dcf5d show recent output
claude stop 7c5dcf5d stop this session
​
Run a shell command
To run a shell command as a background job instead of a Claude session, type ! as the first character of the agent view dispatch input. The ! shows as a prefix and everything you type after it is the command. The following example dispatches pytest -x from the agent view input box:
! pytest -x
Press Enter to start the job. The same job can also be launched directly from your shell with --exec:
claude --bg --exec 'pytest -x'
The command runs as a PTY-backed job and appears as a row in agent view, with the most recent line of output as its status. A shell job runs the command in place of Claude, so no model is invoked and the output is not sent to any session.
To see the output, attach to the row, press Space to peek without attaching, or run claude logs <id> from your shell. The captured output stays in memory and is not written to disk. The row and its output clean up automatically about five minutes after the command exits, so read it before then if you need the result.
​
How file edits are isolated
Every background session, whether started from agent view, /bg, or claude --bg, starts in your working directory. Before editing files, Claude moves the session into an isolated git worktree under .claude/worktrees/, so parallel sessions can read the same checkout but each writes to its own.
Claude skips the worktree when:
The session is already inside a linked git worktree, whether Claude created it under .claude/worktrees/ or you created it with git worktree add somewhere else
The working directory isn’t a git repository and no WorktreeCreate hook is configured
The write is outside the working directory
To turn off worktree isolation for a repository where git worktrees are impractical, set worktree.bgIsolation to "none". Background sessions then edit your working copy directly without moving into a worktree first. Add the setting to the project’s .claude/settings.json:
{
"worktree": {
"bgIsolation": "none"
}
}
The worktree.bgIsolation setting requires Claude Code v2.1.143 or later.
Outside a git repository, sessions write to the working directory directly and aren’t isolated from each other, so avoid dispatching parallel sessions that edit the same files. If you use a different version control system, configure a WorktreeCreate hook and Claude isolates edits the same way it does for git.
Deleting a session in agent view (Ctrl+X twice) removes a worktree Claude created for it, including any uncommitted changes, so merge or push the changes you want to keep first. Deleting from the shell with claude rm keeps a worktree that has uncommitted changes and prints its path so you can clean it up yourself. A worktree you created yourself and started the session inside is left in place either way.
To find a session’s worktree path, peek the session or attach and check its working directory.
To make a subagent always run in its own worktree regardless of how it was started, set isolation: worktree in its frontmatter.
​
Set the model
The model name shown in the agent view header is the dispatch default. New sessions you start from the input use this model, which comes from the model setting in your user settings. Set it by selecting a model in the /model picker, or edit the setting directly. To override it for the whole agent view session, pass --model when opening agent view. See Permission mode, model, and effort.
Each background session can run on a different model. To override it for one session:
From the shell, pass --model with claude --bg.
Attach to a running session, open /model, and press s on a model to switch for that session only. The change persists if the session is respawned.
Dispatch a subagent whose frontmatter sets a model field.
​
Permission mode, model, and effort
A background session reads its settings from the directory it runs in, the same as if you had started claude there.
The permission mode depends on how you started the session. Backgrounding an existing session with /bg or ← keeps the current permission mode, so a session you switched to acceptEdits or auto stays in that mode after detaching. Dispatching from the agent view input or running claude --bg from your shell uses the defaultMode from that directory’s settings, or the permissionMode from the dispatched subagent’s frontmatter.
The permission mode you start a background session with persists when the supervisor later stops and restarts the session’s process. A session you launched with claude --bg --dangerously-skip-permissions or claude --bg --permission-mode bypassPermissions stays in bypassPermissions after that restart instead of falling back to the directory’s defaultMode.
To set defaults for every session you dispatch from agent view, pass any of --permission-mode, --model, or --effort when opening it:
claude agents --permission-mode plan --model opus --effort high
claude agents also accepts --dangerously-skip-permissions as shorthand for --permission-mode bypassPermissions, and --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions to make bypassPermissions available in each dispatched session’s Shift+Tab cycle without starting in that mode. Both match the top-level CLI flags.
Passing --permission-mode, --model, --effort, or --dangerously-skip-permissions to claude agents requires Claude Code v2.1.142 or later. --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions on claude agents requires v2.1.143 or later. Earlier versions reject these flags with an unknown-option error.
The active defaults appear in the footer below the dispatch input.
Without these flags, the session uses the defaultMode from that directory’s settings or the permissionMode from the dispatched subagent’s frontmatter, and the model shown in the agent view header.
Using bypassPermissions or auto is refused until you have accepted that mode by running claude with it once interactively, since those modes let a session you aren’t watching act without approval. The same applies whether you pass the mode to claude agents or to claude --bg --permission-mode.
​
Settings, plugins, and MCP servers
Agent view accepts the same configuration flags as claude for loading settings, plugins, MCP servers, and additional directories. These flags require Claude Code v2.1.142 or later. Each flag applies to agent view itself and is passed through to every session you dispatch from it, so a plugin or MCP server you load this way is available in those sessions too.
Flag Effect
--settings <file-or-json> Override settings for agent view and dispatched sessions
--add-dir <path> Grant file access to an additional directory
--plugin-dir <path> Load a plugin from a local directory
--mcp-config <file-or-json> Load MCP servers from a config file or JSON string
--strict-mcp-config Use only the MCP servers from --mcp-config, ignoring other MCP configuration
Repeat --add-dir, --plugin-dir, or --mcp-config once per value. The space-separated form, such as --add-dir a b c, is not supported with claude agents.
The following example opens agent view with a settings override and one extra directory:
claude agents --settings ./ci-settings.json --add-dir ../shared-lib
​
Manage sessions from the shell
Every background session has a short ID you can use from the shell. The ID is printed when you start a session with claude --bg, and each session’s ID is its directory name under ~/.claude/jobs/. These commands are useful for scripting or when you don’t want to open agent view.
Command Purpose
claude agents Open agent view
claude agents --cwd <path> Open agent view scoped to sessions started under <path>
claude agents --json Print live sessions as a JSON array and exit. Each entry has pid, cwd, kind, and startedAt, plus sessionId, name, and status when set. Combine with --cwd <path> to filter
claude attach <id> Attach to a session in this terminal
claude logs <id> Print the session’s recent output
claude stop <id> Stop a session. Also accepts claude kill
claude respawn <id> Restart a session, running or stopped, with its conversation intact, e.g. to pick up an updated Claude Code binary
claude respawn --all Restart every running session, e.g. to move all sessions onto an updated Claude Code binary at once
claude rm <id> Remove a session from the list. Removes a worktree Claude created for the session if it has no uncommitted changes; otherwise prints the worktree path so you can clean it up. Leaves a worktree you created yourself in place. The conversation transcript stays on your local machine and remains available through claude --resume
claude daemon status Print the supervisor’s state, version, socket directory, and worker count
​
How background sessions are hosted
Every session listed in agent view is considered a background session, whether or not you’re currently attached to it. By contrast, a session started by running claude directly is tied to that terminal and ends when it closes, unless you send it to the background.
​
The supervisor process
Background sessions are hosted by a per-user supervisor process, separate from your terminal and from agent view. The supervisor starts automatically the first time you background a session or open agent view, and you don’t manage it directly.
The supervisor and its sessions authenticate with the same credentials as your interactive sessions and make no additional network connections beyond the model API.
Each background session is its own Claude Code process, managed by the supervisor rather than tied to your terminal. A session that’s actively working, waiting for your input, or has a terminal attached keeps its process running. A running background shell command, subagent, dynamic workflow, or monitor counts as active work, so a long-running process such as a dev server keeps the session alive.
Once a session finishes and sits unattached for about an hour, the supervisor stops its process to free resources. A session you have pinned with Ctrl+T is exempt and keeps its process running while idle. The transcript and state stay on disk either way, and the next time you attach, peek, or reply to a stopped session, the supervisor starts a fresh process from where it left off. When every session has finished and no terminal is connected, the supervisor itself exits and starts again the next time you need it.
When the host runs low on memory, the supervisor stops idle non-pinned sessions first and stops idle pinned ones only if that freed nothing.
The supervisor watches the installed Claude Code binary on disk and restarts into the new version after the regular auto-updater replaces it. This is a local file watch, not a network check. Background sessions are detached processes, so they keep running through the restart and the new supervisor reconnects to them. An idle pinned session is also restarted in place onto the new version so it picks up the update without you reattaching.
​
Where state is stored
Session state is stored under your Claude Code config directory. If you set CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, the supervisor uses that directory instead of ~/.claude and runs as a separate instance with its own sessions.
Path Contents
~/.claude/daemon.log Supervisor log
~/.claude/daemon/roster.json List of running background sessions, used to reconnect after a restart
~/.claude/jobs/<id>/state.json Per-session state shown in agent view
To inspect this state without reading the files directly, run claude daemon status. It reports whether the supervisor is reachable, its process ID and version, the socket directory, and how many background sessions are live. /doctor includes a summary of the same check. On Windows, claude daemon status surfaces the underlying file error when the daemon’s pipe-key file is locked or unreadable instead of reporting a generic connection failure.
​
Turn off agent view
To turn off background agents and agent view entirely, set the disableAgentView setting to true or set the CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AGENT_VIEW environment variable. Administrators can enforce this through managed settings.
​
Troubleshooting
​
claude agents lists subagents instead of opening agent view
If claude agents prints a count followed by your configured subagents and then exits, agent view is unavailable in your environment. Earlier versions didn’t open agent view in every environment, including when connected through Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Foundry. Run claude update to install the latest version.
If agent view still does not open after updating, check whether it has been turned off by a setting or environment variable.
​
Agent view opens with no sessions
Before you dispatch your first session, agent view shows a short onboarding hint with example prompts in place of the session list. Type a prompt in the input at the bottom and press Enter to dispatch your first session.
​
Cannot open agents because background tasks are running
If pressing ← to background the current session shows Cannot open agents — N background task(s) running, the session has in-flight work such as a subagent, a dynamic workflow, or a background shell command, and the shortcut won’t silently abandon it. Run /tasks to see what’s running, then /bg to confirm abandoning them. See From inside a session for what does and doesn’t transfer when you background.
​
Prompt rejected as too short
The dispatch input expects a task description, not a conversational opener. A prompt shorter than four characters is rejected with a Too short hint so a stray keystroke doesn’t start a session. Describe what you want the session to do, such as investigate the flaky checkout test.
​
Sessions show as failed after shutdown
Shutting down or restarting your machine stops running background sessions, so they show as failed when you next open agent view. Attach, peek, or reply to any of them and the session restarts from where it left off.
Sleep alone does not cause this. Sessions are preserved across sleep and the supervisor reconnects to them on wake.
​
A session is slow to respond after attaching
Once a session has finished and sat unattached for about an hour, the supervisor stops its process to free resources. Attaching starts a fresh process from where it left off, which takes a moment. Sessions that are working, waiting on you, or pinned are not stopped this way, so pin a session with Ctrl+T to keep it responsive.
​
.claude/worktrees/ is filling up
Deleting a session in agent view removes the worktree Claude created for it. claude rm keeps a worktree that has uncommitted changes and prints its path. List leftover entries with git worktree list in the project directory and remove each with git worktree remove <path>. See Clean up worktrees.
​
Limitations
Agent view is in research preview with the following limitations:
Rate limits apply: background sessions consume your subscription usage the same as interactive sessions, so running ten agents in parallel uses quota roughly ten times as fast as running one.
Sessions are local: background sessions run on your machine. They are preserved across sleep but stop if the machine shuts down.
Claude-created worktrees are deleted with the session in agent view: merge or push changes before deleting a session that edited files in its own worktree. claude rm keeps a worktree that has uncommitted changes; a worktree you created yourself is left in place.

Agent teams are experimental and disabled by default. Enable them by adding CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS to your settings.json or environment. Agent teams have known limitations around session resumption, task coordination, and shutdown behavior.
Agent teams let you coordinate multiple Claude Code instances working together. One session acts as the team lead, coordinating work, assigning tasks, and synthesizing results. Teammates work independently, each in its own context window, and communicate directly with each other.
Unlike subagents, which run within a single session and can only report back to the main agent, you can also interact with individual teammates directly without going through the lead.
Agent teams require Claude Code v2.1.32 or later. Check your version with claude --version.

Best practices for parallel work
​
When to use agent teams
Agent teams are most effective for tasks where parallel exploration adds real value. See use case examples for full scenarios. The strongest use cases are:
Research and review: multiple teammates can investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously, then share and challenge each other’s findings
New modules or features: teammates can each own a separate piece without stepping on each other
Debugging with competing hypotheses: teammates test different theories in parallel and converge on the answer faster
Cross-layer coordination: changes that span frontend, backend, and tests, each owned by a different teammate
Agent teams add coordination overhead and use significantly more tokens than a single session. They work best when teammates can operate independently. For sequential tasks, same-file edits, or work with many dependencies, a single session or subagents are more effective.
​
Compare with subagents
Both agent teams and subagents let you parallelize work, but they operate differently. Choose based on whether your workers need to communicate with each other:
Diagram comparing subagent and agent team architectures. Subagents are spawned by the main agent, do work, and report results back. Agent teams coordinate through a shared task list, with teammates communicating directly with each other.
Subagents only report results back to the main agent and never talk to each other. In agent teams, teammates share a task list, claim work, and communicate directly with each other.

Subagents Agent teams
Context Own context window; results return to the caller Own context window; fully independent
Communication Report results back to the main agent only Teammates message each other directly
Coordination Main agent manages all work Shared task list with self-coordination
Best for Focused tasks where only the result matters Complex work requiring discussion and collaboration
Token cost Lower: results summarized back to main context Higher: each teammate is a separate Claude instance
Use subagents when you need quick, focused workers that report back. Use agent teams when teammates need to share findings, challenge each other, and coordinate on their own.
​
Enable agent teams
Agent teams are disabled by default. Enable them by setting the CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS environment variable to 1, either in your shell environment or through settings.json:
settings.json
{
"env": {
"CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
}
}
​
Start your first agent team
After enabling agent teams, tell Claude to create an agent team and describe the task and the team structure you want in natural language. Claude creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work based on your prompt.
This example works well because the three roles are independent and can explore the problem without waiting on each other:
I'm designing a CLI tool that helps developers track TODO comments across
their codebase. Create an agent team to explore this from different angles: one
teammate on UX, one on technical architecture, one playing devil's advocate.
From there, Claude creates a team with a shared task list, spawns teammates for each perspective, has them explore the problem, synthesizes findings, and attempts to clean up the team when finished.
The lead’s terminal lists all teammates and what they’re working on. Use Shift+Down to cycle through teammates and message them directly. After the last teammate, Shift+Down wraps back to the lead.
If you want each teammate in its own split pane, see Choose a display mode.
​
Control your agent team
Tell the lead what you want in natural language. It handles team coordination, task assignment, and delegation based on your instructions.
​
Choose a display mode
Agent teams support two display modes:
In-process: all teammates run inside your main terminal. Use Shift+Down to cycle through teammates and type to message them directly. Works in any terminal, no extra setup required.
Split panes: each teammate gets its own pane. You can see everyone’s output at once and click into a pane to interact directly. Requires tmux, or iTerm2.
tmux has known limitations on certain operating systems and traditionally works best on macOS. Using tmux -CC in iTerm2 is the suggested entrypoint into tmux.
The default is "auto", which uses split panes if you’re already running inside a tmux session, and in-process otherwise. The "tmux" setting enables split-pane mode and auto-detects whether to use tmux or iTerm2 based on your terminal. To override, set teammateMode in ~/.claude/settings.json:
{
"teammateMode": "in-process"
}
To force in-process mode for a single session, pass it as a flag:
claude --teammate-mode in-process
Split-pane mode requires either tmux or iTerm2 with the it2 CLI. To install manually:
tmux: install through your system’s package manager. See the tmux wiki for platform-specific instructions.
iTerm2: install the it2 CLI, then enable the Python API in iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API.
​
Specify teammates and models
Claude decides the number of teammates to spawn based on your task, or you can specify exactly what you want:
Create a team with 4 teammates to refactor these modules in parallel.
Use Sonnet for each teammate.
Teammates don’t inherit the lead’s /model selection by default. To change the model used when the prompt doesn’t specify one, set Default teammate model in /config. Pick Default (leader’s model) to have teammates follow the lead’s current model.
​
Require plan approval for teammates
For complex or risky tasks, you can require teammates to plan before implementing. The teammate works in read-only plan mode until the lead approves their approach:
Spawn an architect teammate to refactor the authentication module.
Require plan approval before they make any changes.
When a teammate finishes planning, it sends a plan approval request to the lead. The lead reviews the plan and either approves it or rejects it with feedback. If rejected, the teammate stays in plan mode, revises based on the feedback, and resubmits. Once approved, the teammate exits plan mode and begins implementation.
The lead makes approval decisions autonomously. To influence the lead’s judgment, give it criteria in your prompt, such as “only approve plans that include test coverage” or “reject plans that modify the database schema.”
​
Talk to teammates directly
Each teammate is a full, independent Claude Code session. You can message any teammate directly to give additional instructions, ask follow-up questions, or redirect their approach.
In-process mode: use Shift+Down to cycle through teammates, then type to send them a message. Press Enter to view a teammate’s session, then Escape to interrupt their current turn. Press Ctrl+T to toggle the task list.
Split-pane mode: click into a teammate’s pane to interact with their session directly. Each teammate has a full view of their own terminal.
​
Assign and claim tasks
The shared task list coordinates work across the team. The lead creates tasks and teammates work through them. Tasks have three states: pending, in progress, and completed. Tasks can also depend on other tasks: a pending task with unresolved dependencies cannot be claimed until those dependencies are completed.
The lead can assign tasks explicitly, or teammates can self-claim:
Lead assigns: tell the lead which task to give to which teammate
Self-claim: after finishing a task, a teammate picks up the next unassigned, unblocked task on its own
Task claiming uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple teammates try to claim the same task simultaneously.
​
Shut down teammates
To gracefully end a teammate’s session:
Ask the researcher teammate to shut down
The lead sends a shutdown request. The teammate can approve, exiting gracefully, or reject with an explanation.
​
Clean up the team
When you’re done, ask the lead to clean up:
Clean up the team
This removes the shared team resources. When the lead runs cleanup, it checks for active teammates and fails if any are still running, so shut them down first.
Always use the lead to clean up. Teammates should not run cleanup because their team context may not resolve correctly, potentially leaving resources in an inconsistent state.
​
Enforce quality gates with hooks
Use hooks to enforce rules when teammates finish work or tasks are created or completed:
TeammateIdle: runs when a teammate is about to go idle. Exit with code 2 to send feedback and keep the teammate working.
TaskCreated: runs when a task is being created. Exit with code 2 to prevent creation and send feedback.
TaskCompleted: runs when a task is being marked complete. Exit with code 2 to prevent completion and send feedback.
​
How agent teams work
This section covers the architecture and mechanics behind agent teams. If you want to start using them, see Control your agent team above.
​
How Claude starts agent teams
There are two ways agent teams get started:
You request a team: give Claude a task that benefits from parallel work and explicitly ask for an agent team. Claude creates one based on your instructions.
Claude proposes a team: if Claude determines your task would benefit from parallel work, it may suggest creating a team. You confirm before it proceeds.
In both cases, you stay in control. Claude won’t create a team without your approval.
​
Architecture
An agent team consists of:
Component Role
Team lead The main Claude Code session that creates the team, spawns teammates, and coordinates work
Teammates Separate Claude Code instances that each work on assigned tasks
Task list Shared list of work items that teammates claim and complete
Mailbox Messaging system for communication between agents
See Choose a display mode for display configuration options. Teammate messages arrive at the lead automatically.
The system manages task dependencies automatically. When a teammate completes a task that other tasks depend on, blocked tasks unblock without manual intervention.
Teams and tasks are stored locally:
Team config: ~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/config.json
Task list: ~/.claude/tasks/{team-name}/
Claude Code generates both of these automatically when you create a team and updates them as teammates join, go idle, or leave. The team config holds runtime state such as session IDs and tmux pane IDs, so don’t edit it by hand or pre-author it: your changes are overwritten on the next state update.
To define reusable teammate roles, use subagent definitions instead.
The team config contains a members array with each teammate’s name, agent ID, and agent type. Teammates can read this file to discover other team members.
There is no project-level equivalent of the team config. A file like .claude/teams/teams.json in your project directory is not recognized as configuration; Claude treats it as an ordinary file.
​
Use subagent definitions for teammates
When spawning a teammate, you can reference a subagent type from any subagent scope: project, user, plugin, or CLI-defined. This lets you define a role once, such as a security-reviewer or test-runner, and reuse it both as a delegated subagent and as an agent team teammate.
To use a subagent definition, mention it by name when asking Claude to spawn the teammate:
Spawn a teammate using the security-reviewer agent type to audit the auth module.
The teammate honors that definition’s tools allowlist and model, and the definition’s body is appended to the teammate’s system prompt as additional instructions rather than replacing it. Team coordination tools such as SendMessage and the task management tools are always available to a teammate even when tools restricts other tools.
The skills and mcpServers frontmatter fields in a subagent definition are not applied when that definition runs as a teammate. Teammates load skills and MCP servers from your project and user settings, the same as a regular session.
​
Permissions
Teammates start with the lead’s permission settings. If the lead runs with --dangerously-skip-permissions, all teammates do too. After spawning, you can change individual teammate modes, but you can’t set per-teammate modes at spawn time.
​
Context and communication
Each teammate has its own context window. When spawned, a teammate loads the same project context as a regular session: CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills. It also receives the spawn prompt from the lead. The lead’s conversation history does not carry over.
How teammates share information:
Automatic message delivery: when teammates send messages, they’re delivered automatically to recipients. The lead doesn’t need to poll for updates.
Idle notifications: when a teammate finishes and stops, they automatically notify the lead.
Shared task list: all agents can see task status and claim available work.
Teammate messaging: send a message to one specific teammate by name. To reach everyone, send one message per recipient.
The lead assigns every teammate a name when it spawns them, and any teammate can message any other by that name. To get predictable names you can reference in later prompts, tell the lead what to call each teammate in your spawn instruction.
​
Token usage
Agent teams use significantly more tokens than a single session. Each teammate has its own context window, and token usage scales with the number of active teammates. For research, review, and new feature work, the extra tokens are usually worthwhile. For routine tasks, a single session is more cost-effective. See agent team token costs for usage guidance.
​
Use case examples
These examples show how agent teams handle tasks where parallel exploration adds value.
​
Run a parallel code review
A single reviewer tends to gravitate toward one type of issue at a time. Splitting review criteria into independent domains means security, performance, and test coverage all get thorough attention simultaneously. The prompt assigns each teammate a distinct lens so they don’t overlap:
Create an agent team to review PR #142. Spawn three reviewers:

- One focused on security implications
- One checking performance impact
- One validating test coverage
  Have them each review and report findings.
  Each reviewer works from the same PR but applies a different filter. The lead synthesizes findings across all three after they finish.
  ​
  Investigate with competing hypotheses
  When the root cause is unclear, a single agent tends to find one plausible explanation and stop looking. The prompt fights this by making teammates explicitly adversarial: each one’s job is not only to investigate its own theory but to challenge the others’.
  Users report the app exits after one message instead of staying connected.
  Spawn 5 agent teammates to investigate different hypotheses. Have them talk to
  each other to try to disprove each other's theories, like a scientific
  debate. Update the findings doc with whatever consensus emerges.
  The debate structure is the key mechanism here. Sequential investigation suffers from anchoring: once one theory is explored, subsequent investigation is biased toward it.
  With multiple independent investigators actively trying to disprove each other, the theory that survives is much more likely to be the actual root cause.
  ​
  Best practices
  ​
  Give teammates enough context
  Teammates load project context automatically, including CLAUDE.md, MCP servers, and skills, but they don’t inherit the lead’s conversation history. See Context and communication for details. Include task-specific details in the spawn prompt:
  Spawn a security reviewer teammate with the prompt: "Review the authentication module
  at src/auth/ for security vulnerabilities. Focus on token handling, session
  management, and input validation. The app uses JWT tokens stored in
  httpOnly cookies. Report any issues with severity ratings."
  ​
  Choose an appropriate team size
  There’s no hard limit on the number of teammates, but practical constraints apply:
  Token costs scale linearly: each teammate has its own context window and consumes tokens independently. See agent team token costs for details.
  Coordination overhead increases: more teammates means more communication, task coordination, and potential for conflicts
  Diminishing returns: beyond a certain point, additional teammates don’t speed up work proportionally
  Start with 3-5 teammates for most workflows. This balances parallel work with manageable coordination. The examples in this guide use 3-5 teammates because that range works well across different task types.
  Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive without excessive context switching. If you have 15 independent tasks, 3 teammates is a good starting point.
  Scale up only when the work genuinely benefits from having teammates work simultaneously. Three focused teammates often outperform five scattered ones.
  ​
  Size tasks appropriately
  Too small: coordination overhead exceeds the benefit
  Too large: teammates work too long without check-ins, increasing risk of wasted effort
  Just right: self-contained units that produce a clear deliverable, such as a function, a test file, or a review
  The lead breaks work into tasks and assigns them to teammates automatically. If it isn’t creating enough tasks, ask it to split the work into smaller pieces. Having 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive and lets the lead reassign work if someone gets stuck.
  ​
  Wait for teammates to finish
  Sometimes the lead starts implementing tasks itself instead of waiting for teammates. If you notice this:
  Wait for your teammates to complete their tasks before proceeding
  ​
  Start with research and review
  If you’re new to agent teams, start with tasks that have clear boundaries and don’t require writing code: reviewing a PR, researching a library, or investigating a bug. These tasks show the value of parallel exploration without the coordination challenges that come with parallel implementation.
  ​
  Avoid file conflicts
  Two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites. Break the work so each teammate owns a different set of files.
  ​
  Monitor and steer
  Check in on teammates’ progress, redirect approaches that aren’t working, and synthesize findings as they come in. Letting a team run unattended for too long increases the risk of wasted effort.
  ​
  Troubleshooting
  ​
  Teammates not appearing
  If teammates aren’t appearing after you ask Claude to create a team:
  In in-process mode, teammates may already be running but not visible. Press Shift+Down to cycle through active teammates.
  Check that the task you gave Claude was complex enough to warrant a team. Claude decides whether to spawn teammates based on the task.
  If you explicitly requested split panes, ensure tmux is installed and available in your PATH:
  which tmux
  For iTerm2, verify the it2 CLI is installed and the Python API is enabled in iTerm2 preferences.
  ​
  Too many permission prompts
  Teammate permission requests bubble up to the lead, which can create friction. Pre-approve common operations in your permission settings before spawning teammates to reduce interruptions.
  ​
  Teammates stopping on errors
  Teammates may stop after encountering errors instead of recovering. Check their output using Shift+Down in in-process mode or by clicking the pane in split mode, then either:
  Give them additional instructions directly
  Spawn a replacement teammate to continue the work
  ​
  Lead shuts down before work is done
  The lead may decide the team is finished before all tasks are actually complete. If this happens, tell it to keep going. You can also tell the lead to wait for teammates to finish before proceeding if it starts doing work instead of delegating.
  ​
  Orphaned tmux sessions
  If a tmux session persists after the team ends, it may not have been fully cleaned up. List sessions and kill the one created by the team:
  tmux ls
  tmux kill-session -t <session-name>
  ​
  Limitations
  Agent teams are experimental. Current limitations to be aware of:
  No session resumption with in-process teammates: /resume and /rewind do not restore in-process teammates. After resuming a session, the lead may attempt to message teammates that no longer exist. If this happens, tell the lead to spawn new teammates.
  Task status can lag: teammates sometimes fail to mark tasks as completed, which blocks dependent tasks. If a task appears stuck, check whether the work is actually done and update the task status manually or tell the lead to nudge the teammate.
  Shutdown can be slow: teammates finish their current request or tool call before shutting down, which can take time.
  One team at a time: a lead can only manage one team. Clean up the current team before creating a new one.
  No nested teams: teammates cannot spawn their own teams or teammates. Only the lead can manage the team.
  Lead is fixed: the session that creates the team is the lead for its lifetime. You can’t promote a teammate to lead or transfer leadership.
  Permissions set at spawn: all teammates start with the lead’s permission mode. You can change individual teammate modes after spawning, but you can’t set per-teammate modes at spawn time.
  Split panes require tmux or iTerm2: the default in-process mode works in any terminal. Split-pane mode isn’t supported in VS Code’s integrated terminal, Windows Terminal, or Ghostty.
  CLAUDE.md works normally: teammates read CLAUDE.md files from their working directory. Use this to provide project-specific guidance to all teammates.

Agents and parallel work
Orchestrate subagents at scale with dynamic workflows

Copy page

Dynamic workflows orchestrate many subagents from a script Claude writes and you can rerun. Use them for codebase audits, large migrations, and cross-checked research.

Dynamic workflows are in research preview. They require Claude Code v2.1.154 or later and are available on all paid plans, with Anthropic API access, and on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry. On Pro, turn them on from the Dynamic workflows row in /config.
A dynamic workflow is a JavaScript script that orchestrates subagents at scale. Claude writes the script for the task you describe, and a runtime executes it in the background while your session stays responsive.
Reach for a workflow when a task needs more agents than one conversation can coordinate, or when you want the orchestration codified as a script you can read and rerun. Examples include a codebase-wide bug sweep, a 500-file migration, a research question that needs sources cross-checked against each other, and a hard plan worth drafting from several independent angles before you commit to one.
This page covers how to:
Decide when to use a workflow instead of subagents or skills
Run a bundled workflow with /deep-research
Have Claude write a workflow for your task and save it
Understand how a workflow runs and manage runs
​
When to use a workflow
Subagents, skills, and workflows can all run a multi-step task. The difference is who holds the plan:
Subagents Skills Workflows
What it is A worker Claude spawns Instructions Claude follows A script the runtime executes
Who decides what runs next Claude, turn by turn Claude, following the prompt The script
Where intermediate results live Claude’s context window Claude’s context window Script variables
What’s repeatable The worker definition The instructions The orchestration itself
Scale A few delegated tasks per turn Same as subagents Dozens to hundreds of agents per run
Interruption Restarts the turn Restarts the turn Resumable in the same session
A workflow moves the plan into code. With subagents and skills, Claude is the orchestrator: it decides turn by turn what to spawn next, and every result lands in Claude’s context. A workflow script holds the loop, the branching, and the intermediate results itself, so Claude’s context holds only the final answer.
Moving the plan into code also lets a workflow apply a repeatable quality pattern, not just run more agents: it can have independent agents adversarially review each other’s findings before they’re reported, or draft a plan from several angles and weigh them against each other, so you get a more trustworthy result than a single pass.
​
Run a bundled workflow
The quickest way to see a workflow in action is to run /deep-research, the built-in workflow Claude Code includes for investigating a question across many sources. You’ll see agents work through a set of phases in the background while your session stays free, and get one report at the end instead of a turn-by-turn transcript.
1
Run the workflow

Run /deep-research with a question you want investigated. It fans out web searches across several angles, fetches and cross-checks the sources it finds, and synthesizes a cited report.
/deep-research What changed in the Node.js permission model between v20 and v22?
2
Allow workflows

Claude Code asks whether to allow the workflow. Select Yes to continue. The exact prompt depends on your permission mode. See Approve the plan before it runs for the per-mode options.
3
Watch progress

The run starts in the background. Run /workflows, use the arrow keys to select the run, and press Enter to open its progress view:
/workflows
The view shows each phase with its agent count, token total, and elapsed time. Drill into any phase to see its agents and what each one found. See Watch the run for the full set of controls.
You can also watch from the task panel below the input box: a one-line progress summary appears there while the run is going. Press the down arrow to focus it, then Enter to expand.
4
Read the report

When the run finishes, the report lands in your session. It cites the sources each claim came from, with claims that didn’t survive cross-checking already filtered out.
To run a workflow for your own task, have Claude write one, and once a run does what you wanted you can save it as a command of your own.
​
Bundled workflows
Claude Code includes /deep-research as a built-in workflow:
Command What it does
/deep-research <question> Fans out web searches on a question across several angles, fetches and cross-checks the sources it finds, votes on each claim, and returns a cited report with claims that didn’t survive cross-checking filtered out. Requires the WebSearch tool to be available
Workflows you save yourself become commands the same way and appear in / autocomplete alongside the bundled ones.
​
Watch the run
Workflows run in the background, so the session stays responsive while agents work. Run /workflows at any time to list running and completed workflows, then select one to open its progress view.
/workflows
The progress view shows each phase with its agent counts, token totals, and elapsed time. The footer lists the key for each action:
Key Action
↑ / ↓ Select a phase or agent
Enter or → Drill into the selected phase, then into an agent to read its prompt, recent tool calls, and result
Esc Back out one level
j / k Scroll within the agent detail when it overflows
p Pause or resume the run
x Stop the selected agent, or stop the whole workflow when focus is on the run
r Restart the selected running agent
s Save the run’s script as a command
​
Have Claude write a workflow
You can have Claude write a workflow for your task in two ways:
Ask for a workflow in your prompt with the word workflow, and Claude writes one for the task.
Let Claude decide with ultracode: set /effort ultracode and Claude plans a workflow for every substantive task in the session.
You can also run a workflow command that already exists: a bundled workflow like /deep-research, or one you’ve saved.
​
Ask for a workflow in your prompt
To run a single task as a workflow without changing the session’s effort level, include the word workflow anywhere in your prompt.
Run a workflow to audit every API endpoint under src/routes/ for missing auth checks
Claude Code highlights the word in your input and Claude writes a workflow script for the task instead of working through it turn by turn.
If the run does what you wanted, you can save it as a command afterward.
If Claude Code highlights the word when you didn’t mean to trigger one, press alt+w to ignore it for this prompt.
​
Let Claude decide with ultracode
Ultracode is a Claude Code setting that combines xhigh reasoning effort with automatic workflow orchestration. With it on, Claude plans a workflow for each substantive task instead of waiting for you to ask.
/effort ultracode
With ultracode on, Claude decides when a task warrants a workflow. A single request can turn into several workflows in a row: one to understand the code, one to make the change, and one to verify it. This applies to every task in the session, so each request uses more tokens and takes longer than at lower effort levels.
Ultracode lasts for the current session and resets when you start a new one. Drop back with /effort high when you return to routine work. It’s available on models that support xhigh effort; on other models the /effort menu doesn’t offer it.
​
Approve the plan before it runs
In the CLI, the per-run prompt shows the planned phases and these options:
Yes, run it: start the run
Yes, and don’t ask again for <name> in <path>: start, and skip this prompt for this workflow in this project from now on
View raw script: read the script before deciding
No: cancel
Ctrl+G opens the script in your editor. Tab lets you adjust the prompt before the run starts.
Whether you see this prompt depends on your permission mode:
Permission mode When you’re prompted
Default, accept edits Every run, unless you’ve selected Yes, and don’t ask again for that workflow in this project
Auto First launch only. Any Yes records consent in your user settings, and later launches start without prompting. Skipped entirely when ultracode is on
Bypass permissions, claude -p, Agent SDK Never. The run starts immediately
In the Desktop app, an approval card shows the workflow name, the phase list, and a token-usage caution, with Once, Always, and Deny actions. The progress view appears in the Background tasks side pane.
Your permission mode controls only the launch prompt above. The subagents the workflow spawns always run in acceptEdits mode and inherit your tool allowlist, regardless of your session’s mode. File edits are auto-approved.
Shell commands, web fetches, and MCP tools that aren’t in your allowlist can still prompt you mid-run. To avoid this on a long run, add the commands the agents need to your allowlist before starting.
In claude -p and the Agent SDK there is no one to prompt, so tool calls follow your configured permission rules without interactive confirmation.
​
Save the workflow for reuse
When Claude writes a workflow for a task you’ll repeat, you can save that run’s script as a command. A process like a review you run on every branch then runs the same orchestration each time.
Run /workflows, select the run you want to keep, and press s. In the save dialog, Tab toggles between the two save locations:
.claude/workflows/ in your project: shared with everyone who clones the repo
~/.claude/workflows/ in your home directory: available in every project, visible only to you
Press Enter to save. The workflow runs as /<name> in future sessions from either location.
If a project workflow and a personal workflow share a name, the project one runs.
​
How a workflow runs
The workflow runtime executes the script in an isolated environment, separate from your conversation. Intermediate results stay in script variables instead of landing in Claude’s context.
The runtime tracks each agent’s result as the run progresses, which is what makes a run resumable within the same session.
​
Behavior and limits
The runtime applies the following constraints:
Constraint Why
No mid-run user input Only agent permission prompts can pause a run. For sign-off between stages, run each stage as its own workflow
No direct filesystem or shell access from the workflow itself Agents read, write, and run commands. The script coordinates the agents
Up to 16 concurrent agents, fewer on machines with limited CPU cores Bounds local resource use
1,000 agents total per run Prevents runaway loops
​
Manage runs
Once a run starts, you manage it from the /workflows view, or by expanding its progress line in the task panel below the input box.
​
Resume after a pause
If you stop a run, you can resume it: agents that already completed return their cached results, and the rest run live. Resume a paused run from /workflows by selecting it and pressing p, or ask Claude to relaunch the workflow with the same script.
Resume works within the same Claude Code session. If you exit Claude Code while a workflow is running, the next session starts the workflow fresh.
​
Cost
A workflow spawns many agents, so a single run can use meaningfully more tokens than working through the same task in conversation. Runs count toward your plan’s usage and rate limits like any other session. You can stop a running workflow from /workflows at any time without losing completed work.
Every agent in a workflow uses your session’s model unless the script routes a stage to a different one. To control the model cost:
Check /model before a large run if you usually switch to a smaller model for routine work
Ask Claude to use a smaller model for stages that don’t need the strongest one when you describe the task
​
Turn workflows off
Workflows are available in the CLI, the Desktop app, the IDE extensions, non-interactive mode with claude -p, and the Agent SDK. The same disable settings apply on every surface.
To turn workflows off for yourself:
Toggle Dynamic workflows off in /config. Persists across sessions.
Set "disableWorkflows": true in ~/.claude/settings.json. Persists across sessions.
Set CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WORKFLOWS=1. Read at startup, so it applies wherever you set it.
To turn workflows off for your whole organization, set "disableWorkflows": true in managed settings, or use the toggle on the Claude Code admin settings page.
When workflows are disabled, the bundled workflow commands are unavailable, the workflow keyword no longer triggers a run, and ultracode is removed from the /effort menu.

Agents and parallel work
Run parallel sessions with worktrees

Copy page

Isolate parallel Claude Code sessions in separate git worktrees so changes don’t collide. Covers the --worktree flag, subagent isolation, .worktreeinclude, cleanup, and non-git VCS hooks.

A git worktree is a separate working directory with its own files and branch, sharing the same repository history and remote as your main checkout. Running each Claude Code session in its own worktree means edits in one session never touch files in another, so you can have Claude building a feature in one terminal while fixing a bug in a second.
This page covers worktree isolation in the CLI. Everything below assumes a git repository. For other version control systems, see Non-git version control. The desktop app creates a worktree for every new session automatically.
Worktrees are one of several ways to run Claude in parallel. They isolate file edits, while subagents and agent teams coordinate the work itself. See Run agents in parallel to compare the approaches, or skip ahead to Isolate subagents with worktrees to use worktrees and subagents together.
​
Start Claude in a worktree
Pass --worktree or -w to create an isolated worktree and start Claude in it. By default, the worktree is created under .claude/worktrees/<value>/ at your repository root, on a new branch named worktree-<value>:
claude --worktree feature-auth
To put worktrees somewhere else, configure a WorktreeCreate hook. Run the command again with a different name in another terminal to start a second isolated session:
claude --worktree bugfix-123
If you omit the name, Claude generates one such as bright-running-fox:
claude --worktree
You can also ask Claude to “work in a worktree” during a session, and it will create one with the EnterWorktree tool.
Before using --worktree in a directory for the first time, accept the workspace trust dialog by running claude once in that directory. If trust has not yet been accepted, --worktree exits with an error and prompts you to run claude in the directory first, including when combined with -p.
Add .claude/worktrees/ to your .gitignore so worktree contents don’t appear as untracked files in your main checkout.
​
Choose the base branch
Worktrees branch from your repository’s default branch, origin/HEAD, so they start from a clean tree matching the remote. If no remote is configured or the fetch fails, the worktree falls back to your current local HEAD. To always branch from local HEAD instead, set worktree.baseRef to "head" in settings. Setting baseRef to "head" makes new worktrees carry your unpushed commits and feature-branch state, which is useful when isolating subagents that need to operate on in-progress work. The setting accepts only "fresh" or "head", not arbitrary git refs:
{
"worktree": {
"baseRef": "head"
}
}
To branch from a specific pull request, pass the PR number prefixed with #, or a full GitHub pull request URL. Claude Code fetches pull/<number>/head from origin and creates the worktree at .claude/worktrees/pr-<number>:
claude --worktree "#1234"
For full control over how worktrees are created, configure a WorktreeCreate hook, which replaces the default git worktree logic entirely.
​
Copy gitignored files into worktrees
A worktree is a fresh checkout, so untracked files like .env or .env.local from your main repository are not present. To copy them automatically when Claude creates a worktree, add a .worktreeinclude file to your project root.
The file uses .gitignore syntax. Only files that match a pattern and are also gitignored are copied, so tracked files are never duplicated.
This .worktreeinclude copies two env files and a secrets config into each new worktree:
.worktreeinclude
.env
.env.local
config/secrets.json
This applies to worktrees created with --worktree, subagent worktrees, and parallel sessions in the desktop app.
​
Isolate subagents with worktrees
Subagents can run in their own worktrees so parallel edits don’t conflict. Ask Claude to “use worktrees for your agents”, or set it permanently on a custom subagent by adding isolation: worktree to the frontmatter. Each subagent gets a temporary worktree that is removed automatically when the subagent finishes without changes.
Subagent worktrees use the same base branch as --worktree, so they branch from your repository’s default branch unless worktree.baseRef is set to "head".
​
Clean up worktrees
When you exit a worktree session, cleanup depends on whether you made changes:
No uncommitted changes, no untracked files, and no new commits: the worktree and its branch are removed automatically. If the session has a name, Claude prompts instead so you can keep the worktree for later
Uncommitted changes, untracked files, or new commits exist: Claude prompts you to keep or remove the worktree. Keeping preserves the directory and branch so you can return later. Removing deletes the worktree directory and its branch, discarding any uncommitted changes, untracked files, and commits
Non-interactive runs: worktrees created with --worktree alongside -p are not cleaned up automatically since there is no exit prompt. Remove them with git worktree remove
Subagent worktrees orphaned by a crash or interrupted run are removed at startup once they are older than your cleanupPeriodDays setting, provided they have no uncommitted changes, no untracked files, and no unpushed commits. Worktrees you create with --worktree are never removed by this sweep.
​
Manage worktrees manually
For full control over worktree location and branch configuration, create worktrees with Git directly. This is useful when you need to check out a specific existing branch or place the worktree outside the repository.
Create a worktree on a new branch:
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
Create a worktree from an existing branch:
git worktree add ../project-bugfix bugfix-123
Start Claude in the worktree:
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
List your worktrees:
git worktree list
Remove one when you’re done with it:
git worktree remove ../project-feature-a
See the Git worktree documentation for the full command reference. Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree: install dependencies, set up virtual environments, or run whatever your project’s setup requires.
​
Non-git version control
Worktree isolation uses git by default. For SVN, Perforce, Mercurial, or other systems, configure WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove hooks to provide custom creation and cleanup logic. Because the hook replaces the default git behavior, .worktreeinclude is not processed when you use --worktree. Copy any local configuration files inside your hook script instead.
This WorktreeCreate hook reads the worktree name from stdin, checks out a fresh SVN working copy, and prints the directory path so Claude Code can use it as the session’s working directory:
{
"hooks": {
"WorktreeCreate": [
{
"hooks": [
{
"type": "command",
"command": "bash -c 'NAME=$(jq -r .name); DIR=\"$HOME/.claude/worktrees/$NAME\"; svn checkout https://svn.example.com/repo/trunk \"$DIR\" >&2 && echo \"$DIR\"'"
}
]
}
]
}
}
Pair it with a WorktreeRemove hook to clean up when the session ends. See the hooks reference for the input schema and a removal example.
